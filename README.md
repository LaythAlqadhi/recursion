# Recursion and Merge Sort

This repository showcases two code assignments that emphasize the use of recursion and the implementation of the merge sort algorithm.

## Assignment 1: Recursive Functions

This section includes two functions illustrating the power of recursion:

1. `fibs(n)`: Calculates the nth Fibonacci number using a loop and an array to store intermediate values.

2. `fibsRec(a, b = 1, fib = [0, 1])`: Implements Fibonacci number generation recursively. 

## Assignment 2: Merge Sort Algorithm

The second assignment presents functions for implementing the merge sort algorithm:

1. `mergeSort(array)`: Sorts an array using the merge sort algorithm, which is an efficient sorting technique based on divide and conquer.

2. `merge(left, right)`: A helper function that merges two sorted arrays into a single sorted array, a fundamental step in the merge sort process.
